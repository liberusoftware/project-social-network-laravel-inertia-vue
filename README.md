# Social Network · Laravel · Inertia · Vue

Profiles, feeds, communities and moderation. Laravel routes and sessions with Vue pages over the Inertia protocol.

This is a presentation skeleton. Product workflows, identity integration and reviewed API adapters must be implemented and verified before production use. Module plans describe intended behavior; they are not installed or published packages.

Based on [project-boilerplate-laravel-inertia-vue](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-boilerplate-laravel-inertia-vue) at `efc33c1817797b12cd73c9825ebfbdecc8790fc7`.

## Start locally

Clone this repository, enter its directory and use the declared toolchain and committed lockfiles:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
composer install
npm ci
php artisan key:generate
# Configure a new local database, then apply reviewed migrations.
php artisan migrate
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

Generate an application key only for a new local environment. Keep routes, sessions, CSRF and policy checks on the Laravel side. Select compatible core modules through their actual Composer identities; installation and enablement are separate. Inertia is a page/redirect protocol, not an ordinary REST client. This new shell does not install the full existing Filament module suite or a second identity implementation.

## Verify and extend

```bash
composer validate --strict
php artisan test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [integration responsibilities](docs/INTEGRATION.md), the [presentation runbook](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/guides/presentation/INERTIA.md) and the [product scope](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/social-network/README.md). Enable one vertical journey at a time against reviewed contracts. Verify allowed, denied, wrong-tenant, expired-session, validation and concurrency outcomes when implementing protected behavior. A pending operation is not a completed business transition.
